# shortest-path

The project contains a main.cpp file to download to test the game. There will also be 5 maps to test the game with. To make sure that the program reads the right map file, please change the name of the file you want to test as: input.txt. Then, change the name of the previous map file you tested with something that distinguishes it from the other map files. There is also a 1-page report that would explain how to use the program or game and an explanation of the inner workings of the program. The cpp file will also have comments explaining what each function does.
